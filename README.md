# TTC_Delay_Prediction
# Overview
The Toronto subway system plays a crucial role in the daily lives of residents and commuters. Understanding the factors contributing to delays is essential for improving the overall transit and commuting experience. In this paper, we studied and took a deep dive into the delay data, examining trends, identifying potential causes, and ultimately creating a predictive model for estimating delay durations.

The paper is organized as follows: first, we present the dataset and its context; next, we perform an EDA to unravel delay patterns; finally, we introduce our predictive model and discuss its implications for the transit system.
